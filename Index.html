    <h2>APIs</h2>
    <P>The first two APIs I found had expired sites.  Open weather map, this fit with my choice for my Custom
      Web App.  And the second was cat facts.com.  At this point I was ready to pick anything just as long 
    as I could get my APIs to fetch.  I found a Pokemon API and I thought it was intresting.  It had all the
  images of Pokemon, I thought it was clever and fun.  The second was an API of dogs images, I thought that
was fun. </P>
<h2>Connection</h2>
<p>Pictures of pets and images of fictional pets, they both will  make people smile.</p>
